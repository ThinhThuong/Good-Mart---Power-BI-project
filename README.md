# Good-Mart---Power-BI-project
## Introduction
This project showcases my skills in data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive reporting using Power BI. The dataset represents sales transactions from Good Mart, a supermarket chain. I performed data cleaning and transformation by adjusting feature formats, creating calculated tables and measures, and applying DAX formulas to calculate key metrics. The final report provides insights into sales performance, enabling comparison across stores and monitoring overall business effectiveness.

I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to evaluate the sales plan performance of Good Mart, a supermarket chain in Hanoi. The dataset represented expected revenue targets across districts and stores from 2020 to 2022, where monthly planned sales ranged from 0.28 billion VND at the lowest point to nearly 0.85 billion VND at peak months. District-level analysis showed Cầu Giấy with planned revenues above 150 million VND per month, while Ba Đình remained at a more modest 33–46 million VND. At the store level, Đốc Chợ Thành Công was projected to lead with a sales plan of 1.36 billion VND, followed closely by Dịch Vọng and Trần Duy Hưng, both exceeding 1.1 billion VND.

### Slide 2:

At the district level, the analysis revealed interesting differences between planned and actual sales. For instance, Cầu Giấy achieved nearly 1.6B VND in revenue against a plan of 1.8B VND, performing better than most other districts. In contrast, Hai Bà Trưng only reached 0.8B VND compared to its target of 1.2B VND, while some districts such as Nam Từ Liêm, Tây Hồ, and Hoàng Mai reported no revenue at all. This comparison helped highlight which regions were meeting expectations and which required improvement.

From a time perspective, the monthly analysis showed fluctuating results. In January, revenue was 302M VND, falling short of the 361M VND plan. By May, the situation reversed, with revenue hitting 578M VND and surpassing the planned 479M VND. However, by December, actual revenue of 662M VND remained slightly below the plan of 698M VND, closing the year at around 95% of the target. These insights reflected seasonal variations and revealed both opportunities and challenges in meeting targets.

The dashboard also provided visibility into employee-level performance. Phạm Đức Phúc led with 1.61B VND in revenue against a target of 1.76B VND, while Cao Nhựt Minh followed with 1.44B VND out of a 1.55B VND plan. Across all employees, the gap between actual and expected sales ranged from 90% to 95%, supported by trend sparklines that showed consistent but varied growth patterns.

Finally, drill-down tables offered a detailed view of store-level performance within each district. In Cầu Giấy, for example, CT1 Vimeco exceeded expectations with 283M VND against a 270M VND plan, while other branches like Dịch Vọng and Nguyễn Khang underperformed, reaching only about 80–85% of their targets. Overall, the supermarket chain generated 5.89B VND in revenue against a planned 6.43B VND, achieving approximately 92% of the target for the year.
