# Good-Mart---Power-BI-project
## Introduction
This project showcases my skills in data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive reporting using Power BI. The dataset represents sales transactions from Good Mart, a supermarket chain. I performed data cleaning and transformation by adjusting feature formats, creating calculated tables and measures, and applying DAX formulas to calculate key metrics. The final report provides insights into sales performance, enabling comparison across stores and monitoring overall business effectiveness.
The below picture demonstrates the data modelling:

## Results
### Slide 1:

I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to evaluate the sales plan performance of Good Mart, a supermarket chain in Hanoi. The dataset represented expected revenue targets across districts and stores from 2020 to 2022, where monthly planned sales ranged from 0.28 billion VND at the lowest point to nearly 0.85 billion VND at peak months. District-level analysis showed Cầu Giấy with planned revenues above 150 million VND per month, while Ba Đình remained at a more modest 33–46 million VND. At the store level, Đốc Chợ Thành Công was projected to lead with a sales plan of 1.36 billion VND, followed closely by Dịch Vọng and Trần Duy Hưng, both exceeding 1.1 billion VND.

### Slide 2:

At the district level, the analysis revealed interesting differences between planned and actual sales. For instance, Cầu Giấy achieved nearly 1.6B VND in revenue against a plan of 1.8B VND, performing better than most other districts. In contrast, Hai Bà Trưng only reached 1.1 VND compared to its target of 1.2B VND, while some districts such as Nam Từ Liêm, Tây Hồ, and Hoàng Mai reported no revenue at all. This comparison helped highlight which regions were meeting expectations and which required improvement.

In 2022, the analysis of actual revenue compared to the sales plan showed that from January to December, the monthly revenue never exceeded the planned targets. In January, revenue was 302M VND, falling short of the 313M VND plan. By May, with revenue hitting 477M VND and the planned set to 501M VND. Furthermore, by December, actual revenue of 698M VND remained below the plan of 787M VND, closing the year at around 88% of the target. These insights reflected seasonal variations and revealed both opportunities and challenges in meeting targets.

The dashboard also provided visibility into employee-level performance. Phạm Đức Phúc led with 1.61B VND in revenue against a target of 1.76B VND, while Cao Nhựt Minh followed with 1.44B VND out of a 1.55B VND plan. Across all employees, the gap between actual and expected sales ranged from 90% to 95%, supported by trend sparklines that showed consistent but varied growth patterns.

Finally, drill-down tables offered a detailed view of store-level performance within each district. In Cầu Giấy, for example, CT1 Vimeco exceeded expectations with 283M VND against a 270M VND plan, while other branches like Dịch Vọng and Nguyễn Khang underperformed, reaching only about 80–85% of their targets. Overall, the supermarket chain generated 5.89B VND in revenue against a planned 6.43B VND, achieving approximately 92% of the target for the year.

### Slide 3:

In 2022, Good Mart recorded a total revenue of 5.9 billion VND, falling short of both the sales plan of 6.4 billion VND and the previous year’s revenue of 6.9 billion VND. This performance reflects that the company only achieved 92% of its target, while also experiencing a 15% decline year-over-year. These results highlight that 2022 was a challenging year in terms of meeting business objectives.

When revenue was broken down by store, none of the branches managed to reach their assigned sales plans. For instance, the store managed by Phạm Đức Phúc generated 1.6 billion VND, falling short of its planned 1.8 billion VND, while the Cao Nhựt Minh branch achieved 1.4 billion VND compared to its plan of 1.6 billion VND. Other stores followed a similar pattern, with consistent underperformance relative to their targets. Notably, the branch under Phạm Ngọc Thùy Dương reported no revenue at all. This indicates that the sales gap was not limited to specific districts but spread across multiple stores in the chain.

Looking at the revenue trend by month, the analysis showed that from January to December, actual sales never exceeded the planned targets. Although sales displayed seasonal growth with peaks in mid and late months, they still remained below expectations. Compared with 2021, the cumulative revenue of 2022 also lagged behind at every stage of the year, confirming that the shortfall persisted throughout the entire period without any month providing a breakthrough.

From a product perspective, categories displayed highly uneven performance. Household goods, which traditionally account for the largest share of revenue, dropped significantly by 40% year-over-year, dragging down the overall results. In contrast, most food-related categories saw substantial growth: packaged foods rose by 775%, frozen foods surged by more than 4,000%, and cooking ingredients increased by over 1,300%. Despite these impressive gains, their smaller revenue base could not offset the sharp decline in household goods, making it the main factor behind the overall negative growth.

**Overall Performance**
In 2022, the company achieved total revenue of 6 billion VND, with 61,000 products sold, 27,000 orders, and 18,000 customers. This reflects a strong sales volume, but growth metrics suggest that sustaining performance may be a challenge.

**Revenue by District**
Cầu Giấy district contributed the highest share of revenue at 27%, followed by Hai Bà Trưng at 19%. Other significant areas included Ba Đình (13%), Thanh Xuân (11%), and Hoàn Kiếm (13%), while Đống Đa accounted for 10%. This distribution shows that sales are concentrated in just a few districts, particularly Cầu Giấy.

**Revenue by Store**
Ngọc Hồ store led with 393 million VND, closely followed by Đốc Chợ Thành Công at 384 million VND. Several other stores, including Hàn Thuyên, UDIC Riverside 1, and Phan Chu Trinh, contributed between 263 million and 290 million VND. Overall, revenue across stores was relatively balanced, but none exceeded 400 million VND.

**Revenue by Product Category**
Household products dominated sales, generating 3.9 billion VND, or 66.1% of total revenue. Packaged foods followed with 1.0 billion VND (21.17%), and beverages contributed 0.5 billion VND (8.37%). Other categories, such as frozen, dry, fresh, and raw ingredient products, accounted for only 0.1–0.3 billion VND each. This highlights a strong reliance on household products as the primary revenue driver.

**Revenue and Growth Trend**
Revenue showed a generally upward trend throughout 2022, with noticeable fluctuations likely tied to promotional campaigns or seasonal demand. While growth was steady, it was not exponential, and performance dropped toward the end of the year.

**Sales Performance by Region Manager**
Among regional managers, Phạm Đức Phúc generated the highest revenue of 1.6 billion VND but recorded a sharp decline of -39% in growth. Cao Nhựt Minh achieved 1.44 billion VND with a slight decrease of -2%. In contrast, Nguyễn Quang Đức earned 1.12 billion VND with a modest increase of +2%, and Bùi Thị Thanh Phương recorded the highest growth rate of +6%, although with lower revenue of 0.98 billion VND. Overall, total revenue across managers reached 5.9 billion VND, but growth declined by -15%.

**Key Insights**
The company’s revenue remains highly dependent on household products and a small number of high-performing districts. Despite strong sales volume, overall growth is declining, highlighting potential weaknesses in sustaining performance. Regional manager performance is mixed, with some achieving strong revenue but negative growth, while others deliver lower revenue but positive momentum. To address these issues, the company should focus on diversifying product categories, strengthening underperforming districts, and balancing contributions across managers.
