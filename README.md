# Good-Mart---Power-BI-project
## Introduction
This project showcases my skills in data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive reporting using Power BI. The dataset represents sales transactions from Good Mart, a supermarket chain. I performed data cleaning and transformation by adjusting feature formats, creating calculated tables and measures, and applying DAX formulas to calculate key metrics. The final report provides insights into sales performance, enabling comparison across stores and monitoring overall business effectiveness.

I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to evaluate the sales plan performance of Good Mart, a supermarket chain in Hanoi. The dataset represented expected revenue targets across districts and stores from 2020 to 2022, where monthly planned sales ranged from 0.28 billion VND at the lowest point to nearly 0.85 billion VND at peak months. District-level analysis showed Cầu Giấy with planned revenues above 150 million VND per month, while Ba Đình remained at a more modest 33–46 million VND. At the store level, Đốc Chợ Thành Công was projected to lead with a sales plan of 1.36 billion VND, followed closely by Dịch Vọng and Trần Duy Hưng, both exceeding 1.1 billion VND.
